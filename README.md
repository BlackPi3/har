# Master's thesis repository

This repository contains code, notebooks, and datasets for my master's thesis.

Structure:
- Notebooks: several Jupyter notebooks (e.g., `scenario1.ipynb`, `scenario2.ipynb`)
- Python scripts: `.py` files for data preprocessing and experiments
- `datasets/` and `data_gen/` for data and preprocessing code

Next steps to upload to a remote Git repository:
1. Provide the remote repository URL (HTTPS or SSH).
2. I can add it as the `origin` remote and push the initial commit, or you can run the commands locally.

If you want me to push, please reply with your remote repo URL (for example `git@github.com:username/repo.git` or `https://github.com/username/repo.git`).
